# Weight calculator
This project calculates weight on other planets based on mass that user types. There is a second option that shows names of Martian rovers and their weight on Mars compared to their weight on Earth

## How this works
At the start user has two options:
a) Type a mass and see it's weight on other Planets
b) Show the rovers weight on Mars

User types a or b and presses Enter, than if "a" is selected user types mass in kg

The weight is calculated using the formula:
**Weight (N) = Mass (kg) × Gravity (m/s²)**

**Earth_Gravity** = 9.81 m/s²
**Mars_Gravity**  = 3.711 m/s²
**Conversion to pounds**: 1 N = 0.224809 lbs

## Rovers that are included:
- Perseverance (1025kg)
- Curiosity    (900kg)
- Opportunity  (185kg)
- Spirit       (185kg)
- Sojourner    (10.6kg)

## Results
Run program to see weight in Newtons (N) and pounds (lbs). 
Results are saved in 'result/Rover_weight.txt'

## How to run
Install Python and pandas 'pip install pandas'
You can install IDE of your choice, in my case, I used PyCharm
